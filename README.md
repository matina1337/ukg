#### (UF WiCSE Shadowing Program Project SP 21)

Hello, this is my shadowing project for WiCSE's program. I have a lot of friends who skate competitively. Because of the COVID pandemic, a lot of them have found it hard to get new routines choreographed or to find choreographers to work with them in person. This application's goal is to make the choreography process a bit easier, and help skaters with tracking elements they need to perform and give a visual representation.
